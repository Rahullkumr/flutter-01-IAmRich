![](./iamrich.jpg)

- An app which has an appbar saying I Am Rich
- an image from the assets/images folder
- having details of how to change the app-icon in android and ios devices.

## use Image inside the Scaffold:

1. NetworkImage ('imageLink'): from the internet 

2. AssetImage ('images/imageName'): 
  - first you need to uncomment the assets folder in pubspec.yaml 
  - then, `flutter pub get` will automatically run(if not, run it manually)
  - add `AssetImage('images/imageName.extension')` to your code

  - go inside android/app/src/main/res/
  - replace all `mipmap` folders with downloaded ones
2. For ios devices
